# User **Feed**

The idea of this project is to implement a solution for discovering user feed based on followed users

## **Service Specification**

The service should be able to provide:

- A list of the Users posts: (id, body, cover image, author, created at).
- A filter by author.

- Big plus: design this service to be able to handle great load of requests per second, huge content.
